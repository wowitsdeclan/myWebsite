                        Hello, My name is Declan Hollingworth, I am a 2nd-year student at Wilfrid Laurier University completing an Honours BSc degree majoring in Computer Science while working part-time at IBI Group. 
                        <br>I have been programming for nearly 4 years and I enjoy experimenting with various programming languages and new libraries. While Python is my main language and I've been writing programs in Python for more than 3 years,
                        <br>I am always trying to learn new areas of programming and expand on my skills. When I'm not coding you can usually find me at the skatepark or biking around downtown Toronto.
                        
                    </p>
